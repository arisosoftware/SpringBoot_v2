### SQL Server: View vs. Table

#### **User Story:**
- **As a** database developer, **I want to** understand the differences between views and tables in SQL Server **so that** I can determine when to use each in my database design to optimize performance and data management.

#### **Explanation:**

- **Table:**
  - **Definition:** A table is a database object that stores data in rows and columns. It is the primary storage mechanism in a database.
  - **Use Case:** Use tables for storing raw, structured data. They are the foundation of the database and hold persistent data.
  - **Example:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Employees (
        EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName VARCHAR(50),
        LastName VARCHAR(50),
        DepartmentID INT,
        HireDate DATE
    );
    ```
  - **Scenario:** You would use a table to store information about employees, where each record represents a different employee.

- **View:**
  - **Definition:** A view is a virtual table based on a SELECT query. It does not store data physically; instead, it presents data from one or more tables or other views.
  - **Use Case:** Use views to simplify complex queries, provide a specific data representation, enhance security by limiting access to specific columns or rows, or present data in a way that suits business logic without altering the underlying tables.
  - **Example:**
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName, d.DepartmentName
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
    ```
  - **Scenario:** You would use a view to create a simplified representation of employee details, combining data from the `Employees` and `Departments` tables, making it easier to query and ensuring that users don’t need to write complex joins.

#### **Key Differences:**

- **Storage:**
  - **Table:** Physically stores data.
  - **View:** Does not store data; it retrieves data from underlying tables when queried.

- **Performance:**
  - **Table:** Direct access to data, usually faster for large datasets.
  - **View:** Can be slower, especially if the view is complex, as it runs the underlying query each time it’s accessed.

- **Flexibility:**
  - **Table:** Represents the actual structure of stored data.
  - **View:** Can represent a dynamic dataset, often simplifying complex queries or providing a specific perspective on the data.

- **Maintenance:**
  - **Table:** Requires direct updates and maintenance when data changes.
  - **View:** Automatically reflects changes in the underlying tables without needing maintenance.

Understanding when to use views versus tables is crucial in database design, allowing for better organization, data access control, and efficient query execution.

  - **Platform:** Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, UNIX).
  - **Licensing:** Commercial, typically more expensive with options like Standard, Enterprise, and personal editions.
  - **Features:** Known for its scalability, robustness, and support for large-scale enterprise applications. Advanced features like Real Application Clusters (RAC), Flashback technology, and strong PL/SQL support.
  - **Best For:** Large enterprises requiring high availability, strong security, and complex transactional systems.

- **MySQL:**
  - **Platform:** Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, UNIX).
  - **Licensing:** Open-source with commercial support available (MySQL Enterprise).
  - **Features:** Lightweight, easy to set up, and widely used for web applications. Supports replication, clustering, and different storage engines (InnoDB, MyISAM).
  - **Best For:** Small to medium-sized applications, especially web-based ones (often used in the LAMP stack).

### 2. **SQL Query - GROUP BY**

**Q: Explain the purpose of the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL.**

**A:**
- The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like aggregating data. It’s often used with aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, or `MIN`.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT department, COUNT(employee_id) 
  FROM employees 
  GROUP BY department;
  ```
  This query groups employees by their department and counts the number of employees in each department.

### 3. **Schema**

**Q: What is a database schema?**

**A:**
- A schema is a logical container that holds a database's objects like tables, views, procedures, indexes, and more. It defines the structure and organization of data within the database.
- **In SQL Server:** A schema is associated with a database user. You can have multiple schemas within a single database.
- **In Oracle:** A schema is synonymous with a user account. Each user has their schema.
- **In MySQL:** Schemas are essentially synonymous with databases.

### 4. **GROUP BY - HAVING - COUNT**

**Q: How is the `HAVING` clause used with `GROUP BY` and `COUNT`?**

**A:**
- The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups after they’ve been formed by the `GROUP BY` clause. It is similar to the `WHERE` clause but is used with aggregate functions.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT department, COUNT(employee_id) AS num_employees
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
  HAVING COUNT(employee_id) > 10;
  ```
  This query returns only those departments with more than 10 employees.

### 5. **INNER JOIN vs. OUTER JOIN vs. CROSS JOIN**

**Q: Can you explain the differences between INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, and CROSS JOIN?**

**A:**
- **INNER JOIN:**
  - Returns only the rows where there is a match in both joined tables.
  - **Example:**
    ```sql
    SELECT e.employee_id, d.department_name 
    FROM employees e 
    INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
    ```

- **OUTER JOIN:**
  - Returns all rows from one table and the matched rows from the other. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the non-matching table.
  - **Types:**
    - **LEFT OUTER JOIN (or LEFT JOIN):** Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.
    - **RIGHT OUTER JOIN (or RIGHT JOIN):** Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.
    - **FULL OUTER JOIN (or FULL JOIN):** Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.
  - **Example (LEFT JOIN):**
    ```sql
    SELECT e.employee_id, d.department_name 
    FROM employees e 
    LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
    ```

- **CROSS JOIN:**
  - Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, meaning every row from the first table is paired with every row from the second table.
  - **Example:**
    ```sql
    SELECT e.employee_id, d.department_name 
    FROM employees e 
    CROSS JOIN departments d;
    ```

### 6. **What is an Execution Plan?**

**Q: What is an execution plan in SQL, and why is it important?**

**A:**
- An execution plan is a visual or textual representation of the steps that the SQL Server database engine will take to execute a query. It helps to understand how a query is being processed and to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Importance:**
  - **Performance Tuning:** By analyzing execution plans, you can identify slow operations, such as full table scans or improper index usage, and optimize the query.
  - **Indexing:** Helps in deciding whether an index is used effectively and if a new index is needed.
  - **Optimization:** Shows how SQL Server optimizes a query, including join strategies, scan types, and order of operations.

### 7. **Entity Framework Fine-Tuning for SQL**

**Q: How can you fine-tune Entity Framework to optimize SQL queries?**

**A:**
- **Use AsNoTracking:** For read-only queries, use `AsNoTracking()` to avoid the overhead of tracking entities.
  ```csharp
  var users = context.Users.AsNoTracking().ToList();
  ```
- **Query Projections:** Fetch only the required columns instead of the entire entity to reduce data retrieval time.
  ```csharp
  var userNames = context.Users.Select(u => new { u.Name }).ToList();
  ```
- **Batching:** Use `BatchSize` to limit the number of records in a single batch, reducing memory usage.
- **Avoid Lazy Loading:** Disable lazy loading for performance-critical scenarios and use eager loading or explicit loading instead.
  ```csharp
  var users = context.Users.Include(u => u.Orders).ToList();
  ```
- **Use Compiled Queries:** For frequently used queries, compile them in advance to reduce execution time.
  ```csharp
  static readonly Func<MyContext, int, User> getUserById = 
      EF.CompileQuery((MyContext ctx, int id) => ctx.Users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == id));
  ```
- **Indexes:** Ensure that appropriate indexes are present on the database tables for frequently queried fields.
- **Avoid Complex LINQ Queries:** Break down complex LINQ queries into simpler ones to avoid generating inefficient SQL.
- **Use Raw SQL When Necessary:** If Entity Framework generates suboptimal queries, use raw SQL for specific queries.
  ```csharp
  var result = context.Users.FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE ...").ToList();
  ```

These Q&A should help prepare you for interviews where database-related topics are likely to come up, especially with a focus on SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL.
