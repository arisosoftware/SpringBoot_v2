SQL Server table, must using TSQL script to resolve this req.

schema description:

1) Credit Info   Credit ID -- int pk
Credit Review  (Credit ID, Credit Review Id (pk)
Credit History (Credit ReviewID , Credit HistoryId (pk) ,   have column  workflowstatus, workflow date.

workflow: all credit mantains bye creditID, each creidtID have many creditreviewID, and each creditreviewID have credit historyID
if    the last verisoin of creditHistoryId workflowstatus = "cancelled" then it can not create another new credit history for that so it's end.
otherwise the credit can be renew and have history records year by year...

2) Credit - Counterparty ( credit HistoryID (FK), CounterpartyHistoryID(FK)

3) CounterpartyInfo (CounterpartyID(PK))
CounterpartyHistory( counterpartyID(FK), CounterpartyHistoryID(PK), name)

for each credit history workflow change, it will clone counterpartyhistory item and create new onle. but CounterparytID will not change. so group by CounterpartyID have counterparyt info...

Problem req:

1) there's 100k records of credit historyid, and about 6k creditInfo (CreditID) in the table.
2) we need to find out all old workflowstatus = 'cancel' and remove the oldest 50 records credit, included all related counterparty records from Database

3) limit:   if the counterpartyID was using in other credit group. and that credit group last credit history is not cancelled and not in that "to be delete 50 records" , then please don't delete it

however, we still need to find out 50 records to delete.

please give me solution.

To solve this problem, you need to perform several steps in a structured order using T-SQL. Here縲行 a step-by-step approach and corresponding T-SQL script to meet the requirements outlined.

Requirements Breakdown
Find the 50 oldest records with a workflow status of 'cancelled' in the CreditHistory table.
Ensure that records related to counterparty IDs that are used in other valid credit groups are excluded from deletion.
Delete the selected credit history records along with the related counterparty records.
We縲考l achieve this through the following steps:

Step 1: Identify the Oldest 50 Cancelled Credit History Records
We will start by identifying the CreditHistoryID entries where workflowstatus = 'cancelled' and rank them by date to select the oldest 50.

sql
Copy code
WITH CancelledHistory AS (
SELECT
ch.CreditHistoryID,
ch.CreditReviewID,
ch.CreditID,
ch.WorkflowStatus,
ch.WorkflowDate,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ch.CreditID ORDER BY ch.WorkflowDate ASC) AS RowNum
FROM
CreditHistory ch
WHERE
ch.WorkflowStatus = 'cancelled'
)
This Common Table Expression (CTE) will assign a row number based on the WorkflowDate, and for each CreditID, we get the oldest cancelled CreditHistoryID by ordering the rows in ascending order.

Step 2: Exclude Counterparty IDs that are Used in Other Valid Credit Groups
Now we need to exclude those CreditHistoryIDs that are related to CounterpartyIDs being used in other CreditID groups, where the last CreditHistoryID is not cancelled.

We can use a NOT EXISTS or LEFT JOIN to exclude those CounterpartyIDs that are linked to other valid credit groups. We assume there is a table for CounterpartyHistory and that it has a field CounterpartyID.

ch.CounterpartyHistoryID,
),
ValidCounterparties AS (
cp.CounterpartyID,
cp.CreditHistoryID
JOIN Credit_Counterparty cc ON ch.CreditHistoryID = cc.CreditHistoryID
JOIN CounterpartyHistory cp ON cc.CounterpartyHistoryID = cp.CounterpartyHistoryID
ch.WorkflowStatus != 'cancelled'
ToBeDeleted AS (
ch.CreditHistoryID
CancelledHistory ch
LEFT JOIN ValidCounterparties vc ON ch.CounterpartyHistoryID = vc.CreditHistoryID
ch.RowNum <= 50
AND vc.CreditHistoryID IS NULL  -- Exclude if the Counterparty is part of a valid credit
Explanation:
CancelledHistory: Selects CreditHistoryID entries with a workflowstatus = 'cancelled' and ranks them by WorkflowDate.
ValidCounterparties: Identifies CounterpartyIDs associated with valid credit groups (those whose workflowstatus != 'cancelled').
ToBeDeleted: Selects the oldest 50 cancelled records where the CounterpartyHistoryID is not used in any other valid credit history.
Step 3: Delete the Selected Records
Finally, once we have the list of CreditHistoryID records to be deleted, we will delete them from the CreditHistory, Credit_Counterparty, and CounterpartyHistory tables.

-- Step 3: Delete Counterparty records
DELETE FROM CounterpartyHistory
WHERE CounterpartyHistoryID IN (
SELECT CounterpartyHistoryID
FROM Credit_Counterparty
WHERE CreditHistoryID IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM ToBeDeleted)
);

-- Step 4: Delete from Credit_Counterparty
DELETE FROM Credit_Counterparty
WHERE CreditHistoryID IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM ToBeDeleted);

-- Step 5: Finally, delete from CreditHistory
DELETE FROM CreditHistory
Explanation of Deletion Process:
Delete CounterpartyHistory: Deletes records from CounterpartyHistory related to the CreditHistoryID that is about to be deleted.
Delete Credit_Counterparty: Deletes the links between CreditHistory and CounterpartyHistory in the Credit_Counterparty table.
Delete from CreditHistory: Finally, deletes the CreditHistory records themselves.
Important Considerations:
Transactions: It縲行 highly recommended to wrap this entire operation inside a transaction to ensure atomicity.
Foreign Key Constraints: If foreign key constraints exist, ensure cascading delete is either implemented, or you handle it explicitly as shown in the script.
Performance: Deleting large sets of data (e.g., 50 records, plus associated counterparty records) may impact performance, especially if there are many indexes and relationships involved. Make sure you test the script in a development environment.
Final Script (Wrapped in a Transaction):
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

BEGIN TRY
-- Step 1: Identify the 50 oldest cancelled CreditHistory records excluding valid counterparties
AND vc.CreditHistoryID IS NULL

-- Step 2: Delete related CounterpartyHistory records

-- Step 3: Delete from Credit_Counterparty

-- Step 4: Finally, delete from CreditHistory

COMMIT TRANSACTION;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
-- Handle the error appropriately
PRINT ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
Conclusion:
This T-SQL script identifies the 50 oldest CreditHistory records with a workflowstatus of 'cancelled', excluding those associated with counterparty IDs that are used in other valid credit groups, and deletes the relevant records from CreditHistory, Credit_Counterparty, and CounterpartyHistory tables.

I dont want to using Common Table Expression (CTE) ,

please, focus on -- Step 1: Identify the 50 oldest cancelled CreditHistory records excluding valid counterparties
Certainly! To meet the requirement without using Common Table Expressions (CTEs), we can still achieve the same outcome by using subqueries or derived tables to identify the 50 oldest CreditHistory records that have a workflowstatus = 'cancelled', excluding those linked to CounterpartyIDs that are used in other valid credit groups.

Here縲行 a solution that focuses on Step 1 (without CTEs) to identify those 50 records:

Step 1: Identify the 50 Oldest Cancelled CreditHistory Records, Excluding Valid Counterparties
The goal here is to:

Identify the CreditHistory records where workflowstatus = 'cancelled'.
Rank those records by their WorkflowDate to find the oldest records.
Exclude the records associated with CounterpartyIDs that are part of a valid credit group (i.e., their latest CreditHistoryID is not cancelled).
Solution Without CTEs (Using Subqueries)
The core idea is to use subqueries to handle the logic previously handled by the CTEs.

Step-by-Step Approach:
Subquery for Cancelled CreditHistory: Find all CreditHistory records with workflowstatus = 'cancelled' and rank them by WorkflowDate (using ROW_NUMBER()).
Subquery for Valid Counterparties: Identify CounterpartyIDs that are linked to valid (non-cancelled) credit groups, meaning the last CreditHistoryID associated with a CounterpartyHistory is not cancelled.
Combine and Exclude: Use a WHERE NOT EXISTS or LEFT JOIN to exclude CreditHistoryIDs that are associated with valid CounterpartyIDs.
SQL Query:
-- Identify the 50 oldest cancelled CreditHistory records, excluding those linked to valid counterparties
SELECT TOP 50
ch.CounterpartyHistoryID
AND NOT EXISTS (
-- Exclude records if the CounterpartyHistoryID is linked to a valid (non-cancelled) credit group
SELECT 1
FROM Credit_Counterparty cc
JOIN CreditHistory ch2 ON cc.CreditHistoryID = ch2.CreditHistoryID
ch2.CreditHistoryID != ch.CreditHistoryID  -- Don't match the current record
AND cp.CounterpartyID = (SELECT cp2.CounterpartyID
FROM Credit_Counterparty cc2
JOIN CreditHistory ch3 ON cc2.CreditHistoryID = ch3.CreditHistoryID
JOIN CounterpartyHistory cp2 ON cc2.CounterpartyHistoryID = cp2.CounterpartyHistoryID
WHERE ch3.CreditHistoryID = ch.CreditHistoryID)
AND ch2.WorkflowStatus != 'cancelled'  -- Ensure the CreditHistory is not cancelled (valid credit)
ORDER BY
ch.WorkflowDate ASC;
Main Query (SELECT statement):

We select the CreditHistoryID, CreditReviewID, CreditID, WorkflowStatus, WorkflowDate, and CounterpartyHistoryID from CreditHistory where the workflowstatus = 'cancelled'.
The TOP 50 clause ensures we only fetch the 50 oldest records, ordered by WorkflowDate in ascending order.
Exclusion of Valid Counterparties (NOT EXISTS subquery):

We use the NOT EXISTS clause to exclude those CreditHistory records that are associated with a CounterpartyID used in any other valid credit group. A valid credit group is defined as having a workflowstatus != 'cancelled' for its latest CreditHistoryID.
The inner subquery checks if there exists a record in the Credit_Counterparty table that links the CounterpartyHistoryID to a valid credit history (not cancelled). If such a record exists, the current CreditHistoryID will be excluded.
Subquery Details:

The inner query checks for CounterpartyID associations that are not related to the currently selected CreditHistoryID (ch.CreditHistoryID != ch2.CreditHistoryID).
It also ensures that the associated CreditHistory record is not cancelled (ch2.WorkflowStatus != 'cancelled').
Ordering:

The ORDER BY ch.WorkflowDate ASC ensures that the oldest cancelled CreditHistory records (based on the WorkflowDate) are returned.
Step 2: Deleting the Identified Records
Once we have identified the 50 records to delete, the deletion process is the same as before:

-- Step 1: Identify the 50 oldest cancelled CreditHistory records, excluding valid counterparties
INTO #ToBeDeleted
ch2.CreditHistoryID != ch.CreditHistoryID
AND ch2.WorkflowStatus != 'cancelled'

WHERE CreditHistoryID IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #ToBeDeleted)

WHERE CreditHistoryID IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #ToBeDeleted);

-- Clean up temporary table
DROP TABLE #ToBeDeleted;
Explanation of Deletion:
Identify Records to Delete: We use the same query to find the 50 records to delete and store them in a temporary table (#ToBeDeleted).
Delete Related Records:
We delete the related records from CounterpartyHistory through the Credit_Counterparty join.
Then, we delete from Credit_Counterparty and finally, CreditHistory.
Temporary Table: The temporary table #ToBeDeleted is used to hold the list of CreditHistoryID values to be deleted and is dropped at the end.
This solution avoids using CTEs and focuses on using subqueries to identify the 50 oldest CreditHistory records with workflowstatus = 'cancelled', excluding those linked to valid counterparties. The deletion steps follow the same logic as before, ensuring proper cascading of deletes for related records in the CounterpartyHistory and Credit_Counterparty tables.

if I have more sub query condition for remove like counterparty, for example ta , tb , tc...

is it better using cursor and have a #final list table to hold and give examplaion coumn such as CounterparytInUsed, TableAInUsed...
Yes, using a cursor could be an alternative approach if you have more subquery conditions or complex logic for filtering the records to delete. However, cursors can sometimes be inefficient, especially when dealing with large datasets. Before resorting to a cursor, you should assess if a set-based solution (like subqueries or JOINs) can handle the logic.

That said, if the logic becomes increasingly complex with additional conditions, a cursor combined with a temporary table (#final_list) can help organize and track the records that meet various conditions for deletion. The temporary table can store information such as which tables are involved in each record's deletion, and then you can process these records step-by-step with a cursor.

Using a Cursor and Temporary Table for Complex Conditions:
Scenario:
Let's assume you have multiple conditions (e.g., CounterpartyInUsed, TableAInUsed, TableBInUsed, etc.), and based on those conditions, you want to delete records across multiple related tables (e.g., CounterpartyHistory, CreditHistory, Credit_Counterparty, etc.).

We can use a temporary table to store the final list of records that need deletion, and the cursor can then loop through these records to determine which specific tables need to be processed.

Step 1: Identify Records to Delete
First, you will identify all the CreditHistoryID records that meet your deletion criteria and insert them into a temporary table (#final_list). This table can include additional columns (e.g., CounterpartyInUsed, TableAInUsed, TableBInUsed, etc.) to track the conditions applied.

Step 2: Create the Cursor to Process Records
Once you have the records in #final_list, use a cursor to process each record and decide which tables need to be updated or deleted based on the flags in the temporary table.

Step 3: Delete Records Based on Cursor Logic
Inside the cursor loop, you will check the conditions for each record and perform the appropriate deletions.

T-SQL Example:
-- Step 1: Create a final list of records with additional flags to track conditions
CREATE TABLE #final_list (
CreditHistoryID INT,
CounterpartyHistoryID INT,
CounterpartyInUsed BIT,
TableAInUsed BIT,
TableBInUsed BIT

-- Insert records into the #final_list based on various conditions
INSERT INTO #final_list (CreditHistoryID, CounterpartyHistoryID, CounterpartyInUsed, TableAInUsed, TableBInUsed)
CASE
WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Credit_Counterparty WHERE CreditHistoryID = ch.CreditHistoryID) THEN 1
ELSE 0
END AS CounterpartyInUsed,
WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM TableA WHERE SomeCondition = ch.CreditHistoryID) THEN 1
END AS TableAInUsed,
WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM TableB WHERE AnotherCondition = ch.CreditHistoryID) THEN 1
END AS TableBInUsed
ch.WorkflowStatus = 'cancelled';

-- Step 2: Create the cursor to process each record in the #final_list
DECLARE @CreditHistoryID INT, @CounterpartyHistoryID INT, @CounterpartyInUsed BIT, @TableAInUsed BIT, @TableBInUsed BIT;

DECLARE delete_cursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT CreditHistoryID, CounterpartyHistoryID, CounterpartyInUsed, TableAInUsed, TableBInUsed
FROM #final_list;

OPEN delete_cursor;

FETCH NEXT FROM delete_cursor INTO @CreditHistoryID, @CounterpartyHistoryID, @CounterpartyInUsed, @TableAInUsed, @TableBInUsed;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
-- Step 3: Check conditions for each record and perform deletion accordingly
-- If the Counterparty is in use, don't delete related records
IF @CounterpartyInUsed = 0
-- Delete related CounterpartyHistory records
WHERE CounterpartyHistoryID = @CounterpartyHistoryID;

-- Delete from Credit_Counterparty
WHERE CreditHistoryID = @CreditHistoryID;
END

-- If TableA is in use, don't delete related records
IF @TableAInUsed = 0
-- Delete from TableA
DELETE FROM TableA
WHERE SomeCondition = @CreditHistoryID;

-- If TableB is in use, don't delete related records
IF @TableBInUsed = 0
-- Delete from TableB
DELETE FROM TableB
WHERE AnotherCondition = @CreditHistoryID;

-- Finally, delete from CreditHistory

-- Fetch the next record

-- Step 4: Clean up
CLOSE delete_cursor;
DEALLOCATE delete_cursor;

-- Drop the temporary table
DROP TABLE #final_list;
Explanation of the Process:
Step 1: Populate #final_list Table

In this step, we gather all CreditHistoryID records that are cancelled and check whether they are linked to other tables (e.g., CounterpartyHistory, TableA, TableB, etc.) using subqueries. We insert the results into the #final_list table, along with flags (CounterpartyInUsed, TableAInUsed, TableBInUsed) to track whether the respective linked records exist and should be considered for deletion.
Step 2: Cursor Declaration and Loop

A cursor is declared to iterate over the #final_list table. Each row contains the necessary flags and IDs for processing.
Step 3: Deletion Based on Conditions

For each row in #final_list, the cursor checks the flags:
If CounterpartyInUsed = 0, the CounterpartyHistory and related Credit_Counterparty records are deleted.
If TableAInUsed = 0, records from TableA are deleted.
If TableBInUsed = 0, records from TableB are deleted.
Finally, the CreditHistory record itself is deleted from the CreditHistory table.
Step 4: Cleanup

After the cursor completes its processing, it is closed and deallocated. The temporary table #final_list is also dropped.
Advantages of This Approach:
Organized Deletion: The use of the #final_list table ensures that we can keep track of all the records that need to be deleted, with the additional conditions applied to each record.
Complex Logic Handling: The cursor allows for complex, row-by-row logic that can handle multiple conditions and dependencies across various tables.
Scalable: As the logic evolves (e.g., adding more tables like TableC, TableD, etc.), you can extend the cursor and temporary table to include additional conditions.
Disadvantages and Performance Considerations:
Performance: Cursors can be slow, especially when processing large datasets. If the number of records to process is large (e.g., thousands or millions), consider optimizing the logic or possibly reconsidering a set-based solution.
Concurrency Issues: Cursors may lock records during the processing. In high-traffic environments, you may need to be cautious of blocking other operations.
Maintainability: While cursors are effective for complex logic, they can make the code harder to maintain compared to set-based operations.
This approach using a cursor with a temporary table (#final_list) to track flags like CounterpartyInUsed, TableAInUsed, etc., is useful when your deletion logic is complex and involves multiple tables with various conditions. However, before using cursors, always evaluate if a set-based solution can handle the logic more efficiently. Cursors are a powerful tool for complex conditions, but they come with performance trade-offs.

sorry you dont got my points.

1) find out top 50 oldest into finalist
2) foreach item in finalist, check all if any other condition is only in finalist , if not
if no -- 2a:  we had to remove that record out of finallist. then pickup next old records from all creditid list (it shouldn't used in finalist before )
the repeat 2) until all item in finalist all condition is only in the finalist.. (all subtable related creditID is in finalist only)
Ah, I see what you're asking for now. To clarify:

Find the top 50 oldest records (e.g., from the CreditHistory table) and place them into the #finalist list.
For each item in the #finalist table, check all related conditions (e.g., CounterpartyInUsed, TableAInUsed, etc.).
If any related record is not in the #finalist (meaning it縲行 part of another group and doesn't meet your condition), you need to remove that record from #finalist.
Then, you need to pick up the next oldest record (which hasn't been added to #finalist yet) to replace it.
Repeat this process until all records in the finalist have conditions that are only met by other records already in the finalist (i.e., all related records for each item in the finalist are also in the finalist).
Approach:
To implement this, you need to:

Select the top 50 oldest records based on workflowstatus = 'cancelled' and WorkflowDate.
Iterate through each record in the finalist list.
For each record, check whether all its related records (e.g., in CounterpartyHistory, TableA, etc.) are also in the finalist list.
If any related record is not in the finalist, remove the current record from the finalist list and pick the next oldest record to replace it.
Repeat the process until all records in the finalist meet the condition.
This solution can be implemented using a combination of temporary tables, cursors, and set-based operations.

T-SQL Solution:
-- Step 1: Create temporary tables for finalists and conditions
CREATE TABLE #finalist (
CreditHistoryID INT PRIMARY KEY,
WorkflowDate DATETIME

-- Step 2: Populate #finalist with top 50 oldest cancelled CreditHistory records
INSERT INTO #finalist (CreditHistoryID, WorkflowDate)
ch.WorkflowDate

-- Step 3: Create a loop to process each record in #finalist
DECLARE @CreditHistoryID INT;

DECLARE finalist_cursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT CreditHistoryID
FROM #finalist;

OPEN finalist_cursor;
FETCH NEXT FROM finalist_cursor INTO @CreditHistoryID;

-- Step 4: Check related conditions for the current record
-- Condition 1: Check if related CounterpartyHistory is also in #finalist
IF NOT EXISTS (
WHERE cc.CreditHistoryID = @CreditHistoryID
AND cp.CounterpartyHistoryID NOT IN (SELECT CounterpartyHistoryID FROM Credit_Counterparty WHERE CreditHistoryID IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist))
-- If the condition is not met, remove the current record from #finalist and replace it
DELETE FROM #finalist WHERE CreditHistoryID = @CreditHistoryID;

-- Step 5: Add the next oldest record that has not been used in #finalist yet
SELECT TOP 1
AND ch.CreditHistoryID NOT IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist)

-- Skip back to the previous record (so the next iteration continues from there)
FETCH PRIOR FROM finalist_cursor INTO @CreditHistoryID;
ELSE
-- If condition is met, continue to the next record

-- Step 6: Clean up
CLOSE finalist_cursor;
DEALLOCATE finalist_cursor;

-- The #finalist table should now have only records where all related conditions are met
-- You can now process the deletions or further logic

DROP TABLE #finalist;
Explanation of the Approach:
Step 1: Create the Finalist Temporary Table

#finalist is a temporary table that will store the top 50 oldest CreditHistoryID records. These will be selected based on workflowstatus = 'cancelled' and ordered by WorkflowDate.
Step 2: Populate the #finalist Table

The SELECT TOP 50 query finds the oldest cancelled CreditHistoryID records based on WorkflowDate and inserts them into the #finalist table.
Step 3: Create and Open the Cursor

A cursor (finalist_cursor) is used to loop through each CreditHistoryID in the #finalist table.
Step 4: Check Related Conditions

For each CreditHistoryID, the query checks whether all related records (in this case, CounterpartyHistory via Credit_Counterparty) are also in the #finalist table. This is done with the NOT EXISTS condition.
If the related record is NOT in #finalist, it means this record doesn't meet the conditions and needs to be removed from #finalist.
Once the record is removed, the next oldest record (which is not already in the finalist) is inserted into #finalist.
Step 5: Insert the Next Oldest Record

After removing a record from #finalist, the script inserts the next oldest record that has not yet been used in #finalist. This ensures that the final list always contains records that meet the condition where all related items are also in the finalist.
Step 6: Continue the Process Until All Records Meet the Conditions

This process continues until all records in the #finalist table have passed the checks for all related conditions.
Step 7: Clean Up

The cursor is closed and deallocated, and the temporary table #finalist is dropped at the end.
Key Notes:
Cursor: We use a cursor to process each record in the #finalist table, check its conditions, and possibly remove it and replace it with another record.
Subquery in NOT EXISTS: This part checks if any related records (like CounterpartyHistory linked via Credit_Counterparty) are not already in the finalist. If they aren縲衡, the current record is invalid and needs to be replaced.
Re-processing: After removing a record, we use FETCH PRIOR to re-check the last record, ensuring the loop goes back to check the newly inserted record.
Performance Considerations:
Cursors: While cursors are used for row-by-row processing, they can be slower than set-based operations. You should be mindful of the performance if dealing with a large dataset.
Temp Table: Using a temporary table (#finalist) allows us to track the records that need to be processed and ensures we only work with the relevant data at each step.
This solution ensures that you start with the 50 oldest cancelled CreditHistoryID records, check their related conditions (such as CounterpartyHistory), and remove and replace records if they don縲衡 meet the conditions. It continues this process until all records in the #finalist table satisfy the condition that all related records are also in the #finalist.

clarify, we want to delete a credit group , it means by creditID. all creditID in finalist, all belongs credithistoryId and coutnerparty related records has to be delete.
Thank you for the clarification! Now I understand that the goal is to delete a credit group (which is defined by CreditID). Here's the detailed breakdown of the problem and how we can approach it:

Goal:
You start with a set of 50 oldest CreditHistoryID records (which belong to a CreditID and are marked as "cancelled").
For each CreditHistoryID in this set, you need to check if all related CreditHistory and CounterpartyHistory records for the associated CreditID also meet the conditions (i.e., that these related records are also in the #finalist list).
If any related record is not in the #finalist (meaning it is part of another CreditID), remove the current record from the finalist and add the next oldest CreditHistoryID (from another CreditID) that hasn't been added to the finalist yet.
Finally, after you've determined the correct records in the #finalist list, you will delete all related records across multiple tables, including CreditHistory, Credit_Counterparty, and CounterpartyHistory, for all CreditIDs that are part of the #finalist.
Steps:
Identify the 50 Oldest CreditHistoryID Records.
Iterate Through the Finalist and Check Conditions:
For each CreditHistoryID, check if all related CreditHistoryID and CounterpartyHistory records are also in the finalist (part of the same CreditID).
If any related record isn縲衡 in the finalist, remove the current CreditHistoryID and pick the next oldest, ensuring no CreditID is left out.
Delete the Entire Credit Group: Once the finalists are determined, delete all records related to the CreditID in CreditHistory, Credit_Counterparty, and CounterpartyHistory.
Solution:
Here縲行 the approach using T-SQL with cursors and temporary tables, as previously discussed. We will focus on finding the valid records in the #finalist and deleting the entire credit group.

Step 1: Identify the 50 Oldest CreditHistoryID Records
We first populate a temporary table #finalist with the oldest 50 records based on workflowstatus = 'cancelled' and ordered by WorkflowDate.

-- Step 1: Create the #finalist table
CreditID INT,

-- Step 2: Populate #finalist with the oldest 50 cancelled CreditHistory records
INSERT INTO #finalist (CreditHistoryID, CreditID, WorkflowDate)
FROM CreditHistory ch
WHERE ch.WorkflowStatus = 'cancelled'
ORDER BY ch.WorkflowDate ASC;
Step 2: Iterate Through the Finalist and Check Conditions
For each CreditHistoryID in the #finalist table, we need to check if all related records (i.e., all other CreditHistoryID records for the same CreditID and all related CounterpartyHistory) are also in the #finalist. If they aren't, remove the record and pick the next oldest one that hasn't been included yet.

Here縲行 how to implement this logic:

DECLARE @CreditHistoryID INT, @CreditID INT;

SELECT CreditHistoryID, CreditID

FETCH NEXT FROM finalist_cursor INTO @CreditHistoryID, @CreditID;

-- Step 2a: Check if all related CreditHistory records for the same CreditID are in the finalist
IF EXISTS (
FROM CreditHistory ch2
WHERE ch2.CreditID = @CreditID
AND ch2.CreditHistoryID NOT IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist)
-- If any related CreditHistory is NOT in #finalist, remove current record from #finalist

-- Step 2b: Insert the next oldest record from CreditHistory (not yet in finalist)
WHERE ch.CreditID != @CreditID  -- Ensure we don't pick records already in finalist
AND ch.WorkflowStatus = 'cancelled'

-- Fetch the previous record (the newly inserted record) for re-checking
FETCH PRIOR FROM finalist_cursor INTO @CreditHistoryID, @CreditID;
-- If all related CreditHistory records are in finalist, move to the next record
END;

-- Step 3: Cleanup the cursor
Step 3: Delete the Entire Credit Group
Once the finalist list has been finalized, we can now delete all the related records for the CreditID that are part of the finalist.

Delete Process:
-- Step 4: Delete all related records for the CreditID in #finalist

-- 4a: Delete from Credit_Counterparty (links CreditHistory to CounterpartyHistory)
WHERE CreditHistoryID IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist);

-- 4b: Delete related CounterpartyHistory records for each CreditHistory in the finalist
JOIN #finalist f ON cc.CreditHistoryID = f.CreditHistoryID

-- 4c: Delete from CreditHistory for the CreditIDs in finalist

-- Step 5: Final Cleanup
DROP TABLE #finalist;  -- Remove the temporary table
Explanation of the Code:
Step 1: The first block populates the #finalist temporary table with the oldest 50 CreditHistory records that are cancelled. We select these records by ordering by WorkflowDate and filtering by WorkflowStatus = 'cancelled'.

Step 2: We use a cursor to iterate through each record in #finalist. For each CreditHistoryID, we:

Check if all related CreditHistory records (those belonging to the same CreditID) are already in #finalist. If not, we remove the current record from #finalist and pick the next oldest record from the CreditHistory table to replace it.
Step 3: Once all records in the finalist list are confirmed to meet the required conditions (i.e., all related CreditHistory and CounterpartyHistory records are also in the finalist), we proceed to delete the entire credit group.

This includes deleting records from CreditHistory, Credit_Counterparty, and CounterpartyHistory tables.
Step 4: Finally, the temporary table #finalist is dropped after the deletions are completed.

Cursors: Using a cursor allows us to handle complex row-by-row logic (checking related records) but may be slower for large datasets. Always check if the data volume is reasonable for cursor-based operations.
Indexing: Ensure that CreditHistoryID, CreditID, and CounterpartyHistoryID are properly indexed to speed up lookups and deletions.
Batch Processing: If your dataset is extremely large, you might want to process deletions in batches (e.g., delete 100 records at a time) to avoid long-running transactions.
This solution achieves the goal of deleting a complete credit group, where the group is determined by CreditID and includes all related CreditHistory and CounterpartyHistory records. We use a combination of cursors and temporary tables to track and validate the records that need to be deleted. After validating the records in the finalist list, we proceed to delete all related records from the relevant tables.

this is great!

but minor change.

1)

this line need to find out related creditID by creditHistoryID, then mark all records for that creditId with "isOut" =1 (by defaut it's 0).

then find out next

the cursor need to add contino , IsOut =0
Great! Based on your updated requirements, here's how we can adjust the logic.

Changes to be made:
Mark all related records for a CreditID with IsOut = 1 if the CreditHistoryID does not meet the condition.
Ensure that when checking the #finalist table, only records with IsOut = 0 are processed.
After marking a record as "out" (i.e., setting IsOut = 1), we need to continue with the next valid CreditHistoryID that hasn't been marked as "out."
Step-by-Step Breakdown:
Mark Related Records with IsOut = 1:

For each CreditHistoryID that fails the condition (i.e., related records are not in the finalist), we will update all records that belong to the same CreditID to mark them with IsOut = 1.
Only Process Records with IsOut = 0:

While iterating through #finalist, we will only consider those records where IsOut = 0.
Find and Replace Oldest Record in Case of Removal:

After marking a record as "out," we will find the next oldest record for the same CreditID that has IsOut = 0 and replace it.
Updated Solution:
Add an IsOut column to the #finalist table to track which records are excluded.
Update the cursor logic to handle marking records as "out" and only processing valid records (IsOut = 0).
T-SQL Code:
-- Step 1: Create the #finalist table with IsOut column to track records that are marked out
WorkflowDate DATETIME,
IsOut BIT DEFAULT 0  -- Default is 0 (valid), 1 means excluded (out)

-- Step 3: Declare the cursor to iterate through #finalist and check conditions

FROM #finalist
WHERE IsOut = 0;  -- Only process records that are not marked as "out"

-- Step 4a: Check if all related CreditHistory records for the same CreditID are in the finalist
AND ch2.CreditHistoryID NOT IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist WHERE IsOut = 0)
-- If any related CreditHistory is NOT in #finalist, mark all records for that CreditID as "out"
UPDATE #finalist
SET IsOut = 1
WHERE CreditID = @CreditID;

-- Step 4b: Insert the next oldest record from CreditHistory (not yet in finalist)
AND ch.CreditHistoryID NOT IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist WHERE IsOut = 0)

-- Step 5: Cleanup the cursor

-- Step 6: Delete all related records for the CreditID in #finalist

-- 6a: Delete from Credit_Counterparty (links CreditHistory to CounterpartyHistory)
WHERE CreditHistoryID IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist WHERE IsOut = 0);

-- 6b: Delete related CounterpartyHistory records for each CreditHistory in the finalist
WHERE f.IsOut = 0

-- 6c: Delete from CreditHistory for the CreditIDs in finalist

-- Step 7: Final Cleanup
Explanation of Changes:
IsOut Column:

A new IsOut column is added to the #finalist table to track records that are marked as "out." Initially, all records are set to IsOut = 0, indicating they are valid. Once a record is found to have related CreditHistory records not in the finalist, all records related to that CreditID are marked with IsOut = 1.
Cursor Logic Update:

The cursor now only processes records where IsOut = 0, ensuring that we are only dealing with valid records.
If a CreditHistoryID doesn't meet the condition (i.e., has related CreditHistory records not in the finalist), it is marked as IsOut = 1, and the next oldest record is added to the #finalist.
The FETCH PRIOR statement ensures we go back and recheck the newly added record.
Mark Related Records as "Out":

When a CreditHistoryID does not meet the condition, all records for the same CreditID are marked with IsOut = 1. This prevents any related records from being processed in subsequent iterations.

After finalizing the #finalist, we delete all related records from Credit_Counterparty, CounterpartyHistory, and CreditHistory where IsOut = 0. This ensures that only records which remain valid are deleted, and those marked as "out" are excluded from the deletion process.
Final Cleanup:

After the deletions, the #finalist temporary table is dropped.
This solution ensures that when we encounter a CreditHistoryID that doesn't meet the conditions (i.e., its related records aren't in the finalist), we mark all records for that CreditID as "out" and replace it with the next oldest valid CreditHistoryID. We then delete all related records only for valid CreditID groups, ensuring that everything related to the valid credit group is deleted as per your requirement.

Great! Based on your updated requirements, here's how we can adjust the logic.

### **Changes to be made:**
1. **Mark all related records for a `CreditID` with `IsOut = 1`** if the `CreditHistoryID` does not meet the condition.
2. **Ensure that when checking the `#finalist` table**, only records with `IsOut = 0` are processed.
3. **After marking a record as "out"** (i.e., setting `IsOut = 1`), we need to continue with the next valid `CreditHistoryID` that hasn't been marked as "out."

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Mark Related Records with `IsOut = 1`:** 
    - For each `CreditHistoryID` that fails the condition (i.e., related records are not in the finalist), we will update all records that belong to the same `CreditID` to mark them with `IsOut = 1`.
    
2. **Only Process Records with `IsOut = 0`:** 
    - While iterating through `#finalist`, we will only consider those records where `IsOut = 0`.

3. **Find and Replace Oldest Record in Case of Removal:**
    - After marking a record as "out," we will find the next oldest record for the same `CreditID` that has `IsOut = 0` and replace it.

### **Updated Solution:**

1. Add an `IsOut` column to the `#finalist` table to track which records are excluded.
2. Update the cursor logic to handle marking records as "out" and only processing valid records (`IsOut = 0`).

### **T-SQL Code:**

```sql
-- Step 1: Create the #finalist table with IsOut column to track records that are marked out
CREATE TABLE #finalist (
    CreditHistoryID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CreditID INT,
    WorkflowDate DATETIME,
    IsOut BIT DEFAULT 0  -- Default is 0 (valid), 1 means excluded (out)
);

-- Step 2: Populate #finalist with the oldest 50 cancelled CreditHistory records
INSERT INTO #finalist (CreditHistoryID, CreditID, WorkflowDate)
SELECT TOP 50 
    ch.CreditHistoryID,
    ch.CreditID,
    ch.WorkflowDate
FROM CreditHistory ch
WHERE ch.WorkflowStatus = 'cancelled'
ORDER BY ch.WorkflowDate ASC;

-- Step 3: Declare the cursor to iterate through #finalist and check conditions
DECLARE @CreditHistoryID INT, @CreditID INT;

DECLARE finalist_cursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT CreditHistoryID, CreditID 
FROM #finalist
WHERE IsOut = 0;  -- Only process records that are not marked as "out"

OPEN finalist_cursor;
FETCH NEXT FROM finalist_cursor INTO @CreditHistoryID, @CreditID;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    -- Step 4a: Check if all related CreditHistory records for the same CreditID are in the finalist
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM CreditHistory ch2
        WHERE ch2.CreditID = @CreditID
        AND ch2.CreditHistoryID NOT IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist WHERE IsOut = 0)
    )
    BEGIN
        -- If any related CreditHistory is NOT in #finalist, mark all records for that CreditID as "out"
        UPDATE #finalist
        SET IsOut = 1
        WHERE CreditID = @CreditID;

        -- Step 4b: Insert the next oldest record from CreditHistory (not yet in finalist)
        INSERT INTO #finalist (CreditHistoryID, CreditID, WorkflowDate)
        SELECT TOP 1 
            ch.CreditHistoryID, 
            ch.CreditID, 
            ch.WorkflowDate
        FROM CreditHistory ch
        WHERE ch.CreditID != @CreditID  -- Ensure we don't pick records already in finalist
          AND ch.WorkflowStatus = 'cancelled'
          AND ch.CreditHistoryID NOT IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist WHERE IsOut = 0)
        ORDER BY ch.WorkflowDate ASC;

        -- Fetch the previous record (the newly inserted record) for re-checking
        FETCH PRIOR FROM finalist_cursor INTO @CreditHistoryID, @CreditID;
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        -- If all related CreditHistory records are in finalist, move to the next record
        FETCH NEXT FROM finalist_cursor INTO @CreditHistoryID, @CreditID;
    END
END;

-- Step 5: Cleanup the cursor
CLOSE finalist_cursor;
DEALLOCATE finalist_cursor;

-- Step 6: Delete all related records for the CreditID in #finalist

-- 6a: Delete from Credit_Counterparty (links CreditHistory to CounterpartyHistory)
DELETE FROM Credit_Counterparty
WHERE CreditHistoryID IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist WHERE IsOut = 0);

-- 6b: Delete related CounterpartyHistory records for each CreditHistory in the finalist
DELETE FROM CounterpartyHistory
WHERE CounterpartyHistoryID IN (
    SELECT CounterpartyHistoryID 
    FROM Credit_Counterparty cc
    JOIN #finalist f ON cc.CreditHistoryID = f.CreditHistoryID
    WHERE f.IsOut = 0
);

-- 6c: Delete from CreditHistory for the CreditIDs in finalist
DELETE FROM CreditHistory
WHERE CreditHistoryID IN (SELECT CreditHistoryID FROM #finalist WHERE IsOut = 0);

-- Step 7: Final Cleanup
DROP TABLE #finalist;  -- Remove the temporary table
```

### **Explanation of Changes:**

1. **`IsOut` Column**: 
   - A new `IsOut` column is added to the `#finalist` table to track records that are marked as "out." Initially, all records are set to `IsOut = 0`, indicating they are valid. Once a record is found to have related `CreditHistory` records not in the finalist, all records related to that `CreditID` are marked with `IsOut = 1`.

2. **Cursor Logic Update**:
   - The cursor now only processes records where `IsOut = 0`, ensuring that we are only dealing with valid records.
   - If a `CreditHistoryID` doesn't meet the condition (i.e., has related `CreditHistory` records not in the finalist), it is marked as `IsOut = 1`, and the next oldest record is added to the `#finalist`.
   - The `FETCH PRIOR` statement ensures we go back and recheck the newly added record.

3. **Mark Related Records as "Out"**:
   - When a `CreditHistoryID` does not meet the condition, all records for the same `CreditID` are marked with `IsOut = 1`. This prevents any related records from being processed in subsequent iterations.

4. **Delete Process**:
   - After finalizing the `#finalist`, we delete all related records from `Credit_Counterparty`, `CounterpartyHistory`, and `CreditHistory` where `IsOut = 0`. This ensures that only records which remain valid are deleted, and those marked as "out" are excluded from the deletion process.

5. **Final Cleanup**:
   - After the deletions, the `#finalist` temporary table is dropped.

### **Conclusion:**

This solution ensures that when we encounter a `CreditHistoryID` that doesn't meet the conditions (i.e., its related records aren't in the finalist), we mark **all records for that `CreditID` as "out"** and replace it with the next oldest valid `CreditHistoryID`. We then delete all related records only for valid `CreditID` groups, ensuring that everything related to the valid credit group is deleted as per your requirement.
